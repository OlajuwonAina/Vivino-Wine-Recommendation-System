# Welcome to My Vivino
***

## Task
The project aims to build a wine recommendation system using data obtained from the Vivino website, and the challenge was to gather information from the website's dynamic content, and then build the recommendation system.

## Description
In the project, we used Selenium, an open-source web scraping tool, to automate interactions with web browsers and gather the necessary data, clean and analyze the data before proceeding to building our recommendation system.

## Installation
No installation is needed, but the project requires Python libraries like Pandas, Numpy, Selenium, and Scikit.

## Usage
The project uses a WineRecommender class that implements two recommendation methods, KNeighbors and Similarity, to identify wines that closely align with the user's selection. The data was collected from the Vivino website using web scraping tools like Selenium, and exploratory data analysis was performed using histograms to illustrate numerical columns.

### The Core Team
A team of two worked on this project. I, Olajuwon Aina and Winifred Chinenye.
